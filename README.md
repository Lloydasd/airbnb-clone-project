 AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a simplified clone of AirBnB created as part of my learning journey in frontend development.  
The goal is to practice building real-world applications while improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Over time, I plan to expand it into a fullstack project with backend features.

## Project Goals
- Strengthen JavaScript and debugging skills.  
- Build responsive, user-friendly interfaces.  
- Learn how to connect frontend to backend APIs.  
- Practice using Git and GitHub for version control.  
- Deploy a working demo online.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (later React)  
- **Backend (planned):** Node.js, Express  
- **Database (planned):** MongoDB or PostgreSQL  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Deployment:** Vercel or Netlify (frontend), Render (backend)

## UI/UX Design Planning  

### ðŸŽ¯ Design Goals  
- Create an intuitive booking flow  
- Maintain visual consistency across pages  
- Ensure fast loading times  
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness  

### ðŸŒŸ Key Features  
- Property search and filtering  
- Detailed property viewing  
- Secure checkout process  
- User authentication  

### ðŸ“‘ Primary Pages  

| Page                  | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View**  | Grid display of available properties with filters |
| **Listing Detailed View**  | Complete property details with images and booking form |
| **Simple Checkout View**   | Streamlined payment and booking confirmation |

### ðŸ’¡ Importance of User-Friendly Design  
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction.  
Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are **critical for success**.

### ðŸŽ¨ Design Properties  

#### Color Styles  
- **Primary:** `#FF5A5F`  
- **Secondary:** `#008489`  
- **Background:** `#FFFFFF`  
- **Text:** `#222222`  
- **Secondary Text:** `#717171`  

#### Typography  
- **Primary Font:** Circular  
- **Font Weights:**  
  - Book (400)  
  - Medium (500)  
  - Bold (700)  
- **Font Sizes:**  
  - Body text: 14pxâ€“16px  
  - Headings: 24pxâ€“32px  

### ðŸ’¡ Importance of Identifying Design Properties  
Identifying **design properties** such as colors, typography, and spacing ensures that the entire application maintains **visual consistency**.  
It also makes collaboration easier between **designers and developers**, reduces guesswork, and allows for a smoother **translation of mockups into code**.  
In larger projects, a well-documented design system improves **scalability and maintainability** of the UI.

## Project Roles and Responsibilities  

A successful project requires clear definition of team roles and responsibilities. Below are the key roles in this project and their contributions:
