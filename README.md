 AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a simplified clone of AirBnB created as part of my learning journey in frontend development.  
The goal is to practice building real-world applications while improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Over time, I plan to expand it into a fullstack project with backend features.

## Project Goals
- Strengthen JavaScript and debugging skills.  
- Build responsive, user-friendly interfaces.  
- Learn how to connect frontend to backend APIs.  
- Practice using Git and GitHub for version control.  
- Deploy a working demo online.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (later React)  
- **Backend (planned):** Node.js, Express  
- **Database (planned):** MongoDB or PostgreSQL  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Deployment:** Vercel or Netlify (frontend), Render (backend)
